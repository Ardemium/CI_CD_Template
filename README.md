CI/CD pipeline for microservices


arthurdjamardzhashvili@outlook.com
I have a ci/cd template in a Github repository called CI_CD_Template. The ci/cd works as follows. clone the github repo in the location where the server user ends up after an ssh connection. add the HOST, USERNAME, KEY to github secrets. the HOST is the domain of the ip address. the USERNAME is the user connected to the server and the KEY is an ssh key to be generated and added to the shortening keys on the server. the entire pipeline works with containerized microservices in the backend and frontend. the communication between containers is controlled from an nginx reverse proxy container. for new microservices you need to edit the docke-compose and the nginx.conf. always have a properly configured firewall and make sure that the user's only sudo privileges have the maximum commands, such as docker-compose up. use ssh certificates and never store the private key on the server.

Your CI/CD template in the GitHub repository "CI_CD_Template" is designed to work with containerized microservices in the backend and frontend. The pipeline involves cloning the GitHub repository on the server after an SSH connection, adding the HOST, USERNAME, and KEY to GitHub secrets. The HOST is the domain of the IP address, the USERNAME is the user connected to the server, and the KEY is an SSH key that is generated and added to the server. The communication between containers is controlled by an nginx reverse proxy container. To add new microservices, you need to edit the docker-compose and nginx.conf files. It is important to have a properly configured firewall and to limit the user's sudo privileges to only necessary commands, such as docker-compose up. Additionally, it is recommended to use SSH certificates and never store the private key on the server.

This CI/CD template, hosted in a GitHub repository called "CI_CD_Template," is designed to automate the deployment of containerized microservices for both the backend and frontend. The pipeline includes the following steps:

Cloning the GitHub repository on the server after an SSH connection.
Adding the HOST, USERNAME, and KEY as secrets in GitHub.
Generating an SSH key and adding it to the server.
Using an nginx reverse proxy container to control communication between the containers.
Modifying the docker-compose and nginx.conf files to add new microservices.
Ensuring proper firewall configuration and limiting user sudo privileges to necessary commands.
Utilizing SSH certificates and not storing private keys on the server.
It's a comprehensive solution which covers all the necessary steps in order to have a robust and secure pipeline for deploying containerized microservices.

CI/CD Template
This is a CI/CD template for deploying containerized microservices on a server.

Prerequisites
SSH access to the server
GitHub repository to store secrets
Docker and Docker Compose installed on the server
Setting up the pipeline
Clone this repository to the location on the server where the user will end up after an SSH connection.
Add the HOST, USERNAME, and KEY as secrets in your GitHub repository. The HOST is the domain of the IP address, the USERNAME is the user connected to the server, and the KEY is an SSH key that will be generated and added to the server.
Run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa to generate an SSH key and add it to the server's authorized keys.
Modify the docker-compose.yml and nginx.conf files to add new microservices.
Ensure proper firewall configuration and limit the user's sudo privileges to necessary commands, such as docker-compose up.
Use SSH certificates and never store the private key on the server.
Deploying updates
To deploy updates, simply push changes to the GitHub repository and they will automatically be pulled and deployed on the server.

Communication between containers
Communication between containers is controlled by an nginx reverse proxy container.

Additional tips
Always test changes locally before deploying to the server
Keep the server's package manager updated
Regularly check logs for errors and issues
Please feel free to use, modify and distribute this template.

Note: This is a template and it's not guaranteed to cover all the possible scenarios and it's possible that it may contain errors. It's recommended to test it locally and customize it to fit your needs.
